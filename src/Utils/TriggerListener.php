/**
 * The atkTriggerListener base class for handling trigger events on records.
 *
 * The most useful purpose of the atkTriggerListener is to serve as a base
 * class for custom trigger listeners. Extend this class and implement
 * postUpdate, preDelete etc. functions that will automatically be called
 * when such a trigger occurs. For more flexibility, override only
 * the notify($trigger, $record) method which catches every trigger.
 * Using Node::addListener you can add listeners that catch evens such as
 * records updates and additions.
 * This is much like the classic atk postUpdate/postAdd triggers, only much
 * more flexible.
